# Dynamic Content Engine (DyCE) 

Dynamic Content Engine (DyCE) is an attempt at making a simple decision tree from which infinite combinations of text can be generated and the editor that will allow someone to guide that generation in an intuitive and approachable manner.

Currently, this project is taking the form of a prototype in C# and WPF (best viewed in C# Express 2012 and Expression Blend for Visual Studio).

Eventually, I would like to see this put online as a service that could be accessed and added to by anyone (such as a Google App Engine project), but first we must prove that such a system can work itself out on the small scale.
